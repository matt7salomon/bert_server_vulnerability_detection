# bert_server_vulnerability_detection

How It Works:

	1.	Log Preprocessing:
	•	Each log line is parsed to extract IP, URL, status code, and user agent information.
	2.	BERT Encoding:
	•	The relevant information from each log (URL, status code, user agent) is passed into the BERT model for encoding.
	•	The output of the BERT model is the embedding of each log, which represents its features in a high-dimensional space.
	3.	Binary Classification Model:
	•	The embeddings are passed through a simple neural network to classify the log as potentially vulnerable (1) or safe (0).

Improving the Model:

	•	Use Pretrained Models: Fine-tune the BERT model with a dataset labeled for security vulnerabilities.
	•	Anomaly Detection: Instead of classifying the logs, you could perform unsupervised anomaly detection, flagging unusual patterns in the log data.
